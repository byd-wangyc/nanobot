# Memory

## Structure

- `memory/MEMORY.md` — Long-term facts (preferences, project context, relationships). Always loaded into your context.
- `memory/HISTORY.md` — Append-only event log. NOT loaded into context. Search it with grep. Each entry starts with [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM].

## Search Past Events

```bash
grep -i "keyword" memory/HISTORY.md
```

Use the `exec` tool to run grep. Combine patterns: `grep -iE "meeting|deadline" memory/HISTORY.md`

## When to Update MEMORY.md

Only update `memory/MEMORY.md` when the user explicitly asks you to save something into long-term memory. Do not write to it automatically.

When the user gives an explicit memory-write instruction, update it carefully using `edit_file` or `write_file`:
- User preferences ("I prefer dark mode")
- Project context ("The API uses OAuth2")
- Relationships ("Alice is the project lead")

## Auto-consolidation

Old conversations are automatically summarized and appended to `HISTORY.md` when the prompt token budget is exceeded. `MEMORY.md` is not updated by auto-consolidation.
